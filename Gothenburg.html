<p><b>Gothenburg, Sweden’s chief seaport and second largest city. It lies along the Göta River estuary, about 5 miles (8 km) above that river’s mouth in the Kattegat. Gothenburg is the principal city on Sweden’s southwest coast and lies about 240 miles (390 km) southwest of Stockholm. It is the capital of Västra Götaland län (county).The city was founded by King Charles IX in 1603, on the site of earlier medieval settlements; the location was strategic because the Göta River estuary was Sweden’s only direct outlet to the Atlantic Ocean at that time. Gothenburg was destroyed in the Kalmar War with Denmark in 1611–13, but it was refounded by King Gustav II Adolf in 1619 and chartered two years later. Many of the early inhabitants were Dutch, who built urban canals (in the Dutch style) and laid out the city centre. Gothenburg’s prosperity increased in the early 18th century with the development of the Swedish East India Company, and during Napoleon’s continental blockade the port became Europe’s chief market for British goods. A second period of wealth started with the completion in 1832 of the Göta Canal and the beginning of a transoceanic shipping service.</b> </p>
